# Designathon
By these presents, We have devised a proto-type of software most ingenious from which the import of the manifold dimensionless numbers oft used in the study of that most scholarly of disciplines, fluid mechanics, can be appreciated. Whereas We bring with glad tidings our undertaking of an endeavour most arduous of the extraction of aerosol from large-scale ink-jet printers, We find our redoubtable advances much embellished by our remembrance of these dimensionless numbers. Forsooth it is with this self-same spirit we wish all nubile scholars to embrace, by which this software shall imbue in them the wisdom they so need.

By such means, the cultivation of engineering intuition, indispensable to problem assessment and solution derivation, shall be advanced for the benefit of all learners who shall avail themselvesÂ thereof.
